# Van-der-Waals-Solver
The Van der Waals equation is very useful when trying to determine the specific volume of a non-ideal gas.
This is used in place of the PV = nRT equation.
If you know your pressure and temperature conditions, as well as the critical pressure and temperature of your gas (in atm or Pa and Celsius or Kelvin, respectively),
this program will solve for the a and b constants necessary for the Van der Waals equation. 
Additionally, the program will give you an output value that corresponds to the specific volume of the non-ideal gas.
In order to use this code you run it and input your known values. 
Using the drop-down menus you select which units your temperature and pressure values are.
The equation uses temperature in Kelvin and pressure in Pascals, so if your known values are in Celsius and Atmospheres, part of the code will convert to the correct units.
Once everything is in the correct units, the program will give you an output specific volume value.
